/*
Each section in this file begins by keyword "begin" and ends by keyword "end".
Keyword "begin" could be extended (e.g. "begin_wing0") by name of section:
wing*, fuselage, connections, connections_V.
In the main section reference values (up to row "*****")
can be omitted - then they will be computed using main wing section (section "wing0").
The geometry is defined in the axis system defined as follows:
	origin in fuselage nose, leading edge point of main wing (in the symmetry plane),
	it should be the most forward point of the aircraft body,
	axis x - backward, usually longwise the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC)
	axis y - on the right wing,
	axis z - up.
The geometry should be defined to satisfy positive X coordinates for all aircraft body.
